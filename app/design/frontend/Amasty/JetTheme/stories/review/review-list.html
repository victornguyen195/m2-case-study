            I bike four miles a day to work and back and I love this thing. It's a good size and it's pretty comfortable
            to wear across my back while I ride. So far I have not noticed much wear and tear on the fabric and I've had
            it for 6 months.

            I would love this bag EXCEPT with the case on my Iphone won't fit in the cell phone pocket! Why make a
            pocket for cell phones if it's not going to fit an Iphone.

            Its fine I guess but it's really ugly, I picked out a really cute bag for college but my mom got me this one
            instead.
