            <p><strong>The Group:</strong> All of the above information that we collect, as described above, may be shared among all site's entities.</p>
            <p><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We also may disclose information to outside companies that help us bring you the products and services we offer. For example, we may work with an outside company to: (a) manage a database of customer information; (b) assist us in distributing emails; (c) assist us with direct marketing and data collection; (d) provide us storage and analysis; (d) provide fraud prevention; and (e) provide other services designed to assist us in maximizing our business potential. We require that these outside companies agree to keep confidential all information we share with them and to use the information only to perform their obligations in our agreements with them.</p>
            <p><strong>Other Companies:</strong> We may provide information to carefully selected outside companies when we believe their products or services may be of interest to you.</p>
            <p><strong>Business Transitions:</strong> We may transfer or share a copy of personal information about you in the event that the site owner or one of its properties, affiliates, or subsidiaries goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets. You will be notified via email or prominent notice on our website prior to a change of ownership or control of your personal information, if your personal information will be used contrary to this policy. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with the ability of the owner to transfer all or part of its business and/or assets to an affiliate or independent third party at any time, for any purpose, without any limitation whatsoever.</p>
            <p>Site owner specifically reserves the right to transfer or share a copy of personally identifiable information collected from its websites to the buyer of that portion of its business relating to that information.</p>
            <p><strong>Compliance with Law:</strong> We may provide access to information when legally required to do so, to cooperate with police investigations or other legal proceedings, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our website, to limit our legal liability, and to protect our rights or to protect the rights, property, or safety of visitors of this website or the public.</p>
            <p>Site owner partners with advertising companies to place our advertising on publisher websites on the Internet. These advertising companies collect anonymous information about your visits to our web site. This technology involves the use of third party cookies that allow them to develop personalized advertising so that it directly relates to offers that may be of interest to you. You may choose to opt-out of this service we have with our third-party advertising partner. We may also use cookies to provide similar enhanced online marketing to you based on your interests and preferences. You may also choose to opt out of these enhanced online marketing ads.</p>
            <h2 id="privacy-policy-title-7">Your Choices Regarding Use Of The Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>You have several choices regarding our handling of your nonpublic personally identifiable information.</p>
            <p><strong>Direct Mail or Telephone Marketing:</strong> If you shop at the site and wish to be removed from the list of customers that receive direct mail or telemarketing calls, please either write to Customer Care by means enlisted at "Contact Us" page. If you choose to write to us, please include your name, address, and credit card account number (if you have one), and state one of the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"NO MAIL OFFERS" (if you don't want to receive offers by mail);</li>
                <li>"NO PHONE OFFERS" (if you don't want to receive offers by phone);</li>
                <li>"NO PHONE OR MAIL OFFERS" (if you don't want to receive either).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Because customer lists often are prepared well in advance of an offering (sometimes a few months before the offer is made), you may continue to receive some offers after you send us a request not to use your information for specified marketing purposes. We appreciate your patience and understanding in giving us time to carry out your request.</p>
            <h2 id="privacy-policy-title-8">Your California Privacy Rights</h2>

The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.</p>
            <p>We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyze data about web page traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system.</p>
            <p>Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us. You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.</p>
            <p>A "web beacon" or "pixel tag" or "clear gif" is typically a one-pixel image, used to pass information from your computer or mobile device to a website.</p>

We use this information to improve our site design, product assortments, customer service, and special promotions. You can, of course, disable cookies and web beacons on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your browser.
